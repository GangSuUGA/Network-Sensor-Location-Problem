## Motivation: 
- Nowadays, indirect link counting measurements still take the advantages (easier/timely) to get the O-D trip information than other direct measurements (Household travel surveys, Mobile phone, GPS). 
- Hope there will be breakthroughs for inferring O-D from mobile phone data soon. **Alexander, Lauren P. et al. “[Origin-destination trips by purpose and time of day inferred from mobile phone data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X1500073X#:~:text=Despite%20these%20advantages%2C%20mobile%20phone%20data%20lacks%20information,Stopher%20and%20Greaves%2C%202007%2C%20Hu%20and%20Reuscher%2C%202004%29.).” Transportation Research Part C-emerging Technologies 58 (2015): 240-250.**
