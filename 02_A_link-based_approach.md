Link flow inference is to infer the unobserved link flows based on the observed link flows.
There are two main approaches to inferring link flows:  node-based approach and link-based approach.
Specifically, the node-based approach uses the non-centroid node-link flow conservation equations while the link-based approach uses the link-path flow conservation equations.
