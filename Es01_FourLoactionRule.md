## Rule 1 (O-D covering rule):     
the traffic counting points on a road network should be located so that **a certain portion of trips between any O-D pair will be observed**.       

## Rule 2 (maximal flow fraction rule):     
for a particular O-D pair, the traffic counting points on a road network should be located at the links so that **the flow fraction between this O-D pair out of flows on these links is as large as possible**.      

## Rule 3 (maximal flow-intercepting rule):      
under a certain number of links to be observed, the chosen links should **intercept as many flows as possible**.    

## Rule 4 (link independence rule):     
the traffic counting points should be located on the network so that **the resultant traffic counts on all chosen links are not linearly dependent**.
