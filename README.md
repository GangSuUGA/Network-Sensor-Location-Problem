## MOTIVATION 
There is a growing appreciation of the importance in developed societies of networks (or lifelines) of various kinds, such as water supply, energy supply, sewage disposal, communication and of course transportation. Monitoring and analyzing those big lifelines data is vital importance of the planning and management in smart city. Sensors as the main means to supply such information become growing critical. With the limited budget, the problem of how to optimally locate sensors on a network is our focus. 

- Especially, in this project, we focused on the traffic counting sensor location problem.

## Literature Review: 
 - The sensor location **Flow-Observability Problem**:      
      What is the minimum number of sensors and where to locate them in order to obtain the certain level of links coverage?              
 - The sensor location **Flow-Estimation Problem**:      
      How to choose sensor locations to improve the quality of flows estimates (e.g., OD demands, link/route flows, travel time)?    
 - The sensor location **Flow-Prediction Problem**:
