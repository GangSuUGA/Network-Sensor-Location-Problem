## MOTIVATION 
There is a growing appreciation of the importance in developed societies of networks (or lifelines) of various kinds, such as water supply, energy supply, sewage disposal, communication and of course transportation. Monitoring and analyzing those big lifelines data is vital importance of the planning and management in smart city. Sensors as the main means to supply such information become growing critical in the modern computational intelligence. With the limited budget, the problem of how to optimally locate sensors on a network is our focus. 

- Especially, in this project, we focused on CCS/WIM sensors.

# Network Sensor Location Problem
### Definition: How to optimze the number and location of sensors on a network?  

 - **Flow Observability problem**:      
      Increase the coverage by exact link inference.              
 - **Flow Estimation problem**:      
      Improve the quality of flows estimates.    
 - The sensor location **Flow-Prediction Problem**:
