# The-Optimization-of-Sensor-Location
The sensor location **flow-observability problem** identifies the optimal placement of sensors that allows **the unique determination of the unobserved flows** based on the system of linear equations associated with the sensors.        
The sensor location **flow-estimation problem** identifies the optimal placement of sensors to **best improve the quality of related estimates** (e.g., OD demands, link/route flows) obtained by the system of linear equations associated with the sensors.
