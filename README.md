# The-Optimization-of-Sensor-Location
 - The sensor location **flow-observability problem**:      
      What is the minimum number of sensors and where to locate them in order to obtain the unique solution?              
 - The sensor location **flow-estimation problem**:      
      How to choose sensor locations to improve the quality of flows estimates (e.g., OD demands, link/route flows)?
